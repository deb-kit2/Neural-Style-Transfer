I used this with a GPU on Google Colab, worked really fast.

Normally, even 200 iterations would take considerable time on a CPU.
The GPU proved to be doing it fast. But 200 iterations with a GPU did not produce results as good as 200 iterations on the CPU.

Therefore, if using a GPU, 1500 to 2000 iterations would give a good result.
On a CPU, 200 is good.
