# Neural-Style-Transfer
Hi. This is my first project involving Neural Nets.

The paper can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576.
I thought of using Keras, but it would take time for me to read the documentation.

I found a way to import the VGG16 tensorflow model, thanks to Hvass-Labs.

About me. 
I am making this, just after my first year. 
I did learn a bit about Neural Nets in this summer.
